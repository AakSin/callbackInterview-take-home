                        Your task is to create a React webpage that displays all the NFTs owned by a given Ethereum address (e.g. 0x3F5B1C698D8709Ad1Df6abdB7b836507948CE296) on the Ethereum blockchain.

                        The NFTs should be presented in a grid-like fashion, showcasing the image of each NFT along with the name displayed under the image.
                        <br />
                        Clicking on the image or name should link to the NFT's OpenSea page, which is given by https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/&#123;contractAddress&#125;/&#123;tokenId&#125;.
